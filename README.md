## Simple implementation of 3D curves hierarchy

### Build instructions (tested on Linux)
```make``` to build project

```make clean``` to remove all temporary files and the executable also

All the required functionality works, but I might move the implementation into a library of curves and improve/clean up some of the code in the near future
